# Croeso-Linux-CLI
# 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Croeso CLI - Natural Language Linux Control

> **Croeso** (Welsh: /ˈkrɔɨ̯sɔ/) - “Welcome”

## 🌱 This is a Foundation, Not a Product

**Croeso CLI is an experimental base layer for natural language system control on Linux.** Think of it as a proof-of-concept that shows what’s possible when we combine local LLMs with system automation. It’s intentionally unfinished - because the best ideas come from community collaboration.

## 🤔 What This Is

- **A starting point** for developers interested in natural language interfaces
- **A learning project** that demonstrates local LLM integration
- **A community experiment** in making Linux more accessible
- **A foundation** others can build upon, fork, and improve

## 🚫 What This Is NOT

- **NOT production-ready** - Seriously, don’t run this on important systems yet
- **NOT feature-complete** - Many obvious features are missing on purpose
- **NOT the best implementation** - It’s meant to inspire better ones
- **NOT a Copilot replacement** - Different philosophy, different goals

## 💡 The Core Idea

```
Human: "Clean up my downloads folder"
Croeso: [Understands intent → Checks safety → Executes commands → Reports results]
```

Instead of memorizing commands, just tell your computer what you want. Everything runs locally, respecting your privacy and giving you full control.

## 🚀 Quick Start (For the Brave)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/croeso-cli
cd croeso-cli

# Set up environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Ollama and pull a model
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama pull llama3.1:8b

# Run Croeso (at your own risk!)
python croeso.py
```

## 🛠️ Current Capabilities

### What Works (Mostly)

- ✅ Basic file operations (list, move, organize)
- ✅ System information queries
- ✅ Simple command execution with safety checks
- ✅ Multi-step operations
- ✅ Context awareness (remembers conversation)

### What’s Missing (Intentionally)

- ❌ Complex shell operations (pipes, redirects)
- ❌ GUI application control
- ❌ Network operations
- ❌ Package management
- ❌ User management
- ❌ … and much more!

## 🏆 Challenges for Contributors

We’ve left lots of room for improvement! Here are some ideas:

### Easy Wins

- [ ] Add more safety validations
- [ ] Improve command parsing accuracy
- [ ] Add system monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Create better error messages
- [ ] Add command history/undo

### Medium Challenges

- [ ] Implement plugin system for custom actions
- [ ] Add voice input/output
- [ ] Create GUI interface (not just CLI)
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Better LLM prompt engineering

### Hard Problems

- [ ] Formal verification of command safety
- [ ] Multi-user permission system
- [ ] Distributed execution across machines
- [ ] Visual desktop understanding (screenshots → actions)
- [ ] Self-improving AI that learns from usage

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** This software can:

- Execute system commands
- Modify files
- Change system settings
- Potentially break things

Always:

- Run in a VM or container first
- Review commands before execution
- Keep backups
- Don’t run as root
- Read the safety documentation

## 🔮 Vision for the Future

Imagine a world where:

- Linux is accessible to everyone, regardless of technical skill
- Your computer understands what you want, not just what you type
- AI assists without compromising privacy or control
- The community builds tools that respect users

**This is just the beginning.**

## 🎯 Call to Action

**This isn’t my project - it’s ours.**

Take it, break it, rebuild it, make it better. Fork it and create something amazing. Use it as inspiration for something completely different.

The goal isn’t to create the perfect natural language interface - it’s to start a conversation about what’s possible when we combine AI with the philosophy of open source.
