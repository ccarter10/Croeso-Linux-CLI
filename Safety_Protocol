# üõ°Ô∏è Croeso CLI Enterprise Safety & Security Protocol  
**Version 1.0.0 ‚Äì July 2025**

## Overview

Croeso CLI is a privacy-first, AI-powered Linux command-line assistant designed for secure, local system control. Unlike cloud-hosted CLI copilots, Croeso operates entirely offline while embedding multiple layers of safety controls.

This document summarizes Croeso CLI‚Äôs key security features and risk management approach for enterprise deployment.

## Core Security Philosophy

- **Default Deny:** Only explicitly approved commands execute.  
- **Least Privilege:** No root-level execution unless required and authorized.  
- **Explicit User Consent:** All medium+ risk operations require user confirmation.  
- **Defense in Depth:** Safety measures exist at every layer, from intent parsing to execution sandboxing.  
- **Auditability:** Every operation is logged with full metadata for forensic review.

## Risk Classification System

| Risk Level | Examples               | Required Action                          |
|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| SAFE       | `ls`, `pwd`           | Auto-execute with logging               |
| LOW        | `mkdir`, `touch`      | Auto-execute with logging               |
| MEDIUM     | `mv`, `cp`            | User confirmation required              |
| HIGH       | `rm -r`, `chmod 777`  | Double confirmation + rollback checkpoint |
| CRITICAL   | `dd`, `mkfs`, fork bombs | Block by default; require admin override |
| FORBIDDEN  | `rm -rf /`, `mv / /dev/null` | Permanently blocked                     |

## Key Security Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Command Validation System
- Regex Pattern Matching: Blocks known dangerous command structures.
- Semantic Analysis: Identifies destructive actions beyond simple pattern matches.
- Protected Path Awareness: Automatically blocks commands affecting sensitive directories like `/boot`, `/root`, or `.ssh` keys.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Rollback Checkpoints
- Automatic backups before MEDIUM+ risk actions.
- Restore Points: Users can revert to the last safe state using CLI commands.
- Checkpoint Retention Policies configurable per organization.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Audit Logging
- Immutable JSON logs containing:
  - Command executed
  - Natural language intent
  - User identity
  - Risk level
  - Confirmation actions taken
  - Timestamp
  - Execution result
- Supports secure export formats and retention compliance.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Runtime Monitoring
- Resource Limits: Enforced caps on CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network activity.
- Anomaly Detection: Flags suspicious behaviors such as rapid file deletion or unexpected network access.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Emergency Safeguards
- Panic Mode: Ctrl+Shift+X x3 kills all active Croeso operations and locks down further commands.
- Safe Mode Boot: Run Croeso CLI in read-only audit mode without allowing system changes.

## Deployment Guidelines

- Recommended User Mode:  
  Run Croeso CLI as a non-root user with explicit sudo escalation for high-risk actions.
- LLM Hosting:  
  Croeso CLI supports on-premises LLM deployment using quantized open-weight models. No cloud dependency.
- Integration Options:  
  Supports enterprise SSO, multi-user policy enforcement, and configuration profiles for larger deployments.

## Disclosure & Compliance

- **Responsible Disclosure Policy:**  
  Security issues should be reported privately to security@croeso-cli.org using our PGP key.

- **Compliance Considerations:**  
  Croeso CLI can be configured to align with ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and GDPR data privacy requirements through log retention and audit trail management.
